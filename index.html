  	 <h1>Mother Sauces</h1>
	  	<p>The concept of mother sauces predated Escoffier's classification by at least 50 years; in 1844, the French magazine  Revue  de Paris reported: "Oui ne savez-vous pas que la grande espagnole est une sauce-mère, dont toutes les autres préparations, telles que réductions, fonds de cuisson, jus, veloutés, essences, coulis, ne sont, à proprement parler, que des dérivés?" ("Don’t you know that the grand sauce Espagnole is a mother sauce, of which all the other preparations, such as reductions, stocks, jus, veloutés, essences, and coulis, are, strictly speaking, only derivatives?")
  	     </p>

          <p>Different classifications of French sauces into mother and daughter sauces have been proposed by different chefs, varying   			in number and selection.

  	     <p>In French cuisine, the mother sauces (French: sauces mères), also known as grandes sauces in French or leading sauces, are a group of sauces upon which many other sauces – "daughter sauces" or "small sauces" (French: petites sauces) – are based. Different sets and classifications of mother sauces have been proposed since at least the early 19th century.

	     <p>The pioneering chef Auguste Escoffier is credited with establishing the importance of Espagnole, Velouté, Béchamel and Tomate, as well as Hollandaise and Mayonnaise.[3][12] His book Le guide culinaire was published in 1903. The 1912 edition lists the "Grandes Sauces de base" as:
